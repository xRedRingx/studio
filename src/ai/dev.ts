/**
 * @fileoverview Development entry point for Genkit.
 * This file is typically used to import and initialize Genkit flows
 * when running the Genkit development server (e.g., `genkit start`).
 * Flows imported here will be registered with the Genkit framework.
 */

// Example: import './flows/my-flow';
// Flows will be imported for their side effects (registration with Genkit) in this file.
// Currently, no flows are explicitly imported, but this file serves as the
// designated entry point for the Genkit CLI during development.
